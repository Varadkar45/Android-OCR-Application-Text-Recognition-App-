<h1>Android OCR Application Text Recognition App</h1>
<br>
<h2>Final Year Major Project for Diploma in Computer Engineering</h2>
<br>
<strong>-->Actual Methodology of the App</strong>
<p>◼ The Optical Character Recognition is a technology that allows a gadget to create text strings out of scanned images or, in our case, an image that is captured with a user’s smart phone/tablet.</p>
<p>◼ The objective of our application is to achieve modification or conversion of any form of text or text-containing documents such as printed or scanned text images, into an editable digital format for deeper and further processing.</p>
<p>Our Application will run according to three major steps:

<strong>1.</strong> Text Detection:- Firstly the app will go through the image and find the
regions where there is text in an image.

<strong>2.</strong> Character Segmentation:- Secondly , given that the rectangle around the text
region, we can do character segmentation where we segment the characters in
the specified rectangle which is chosen by the user from the selected image .

<strong>3.</strong> Character Classification:- And finally, having segmented it out into
individual characters, we can then run a classifier which looks at the images of
the individual characters and tries to figure out the letters. And so on, till you
find out what all the characters are and what the entire text is.</p>
